## Contributing ##


At this time my personal preference is to work on growing the library and to focus a bit on manual curation later. This is done under the assumption that at this time the library is very much in a development stage and improvements and changes can come at a later point in time.


Eventually I would like to formalize a formal pipeline for contributing once things are stable.
