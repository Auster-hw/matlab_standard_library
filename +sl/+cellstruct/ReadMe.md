sl.cellstruct
-------------

I've decided to introduce sl.cellstruct for functions that work with cellstructs. This term refers to a cell array of structures. The size of the structure is ambiguous and I'd like that to be decided on a function by function basis (i.e. whether or not the structures have only 1 element or many). The name cellstruct is made with reference to cellstr, an oft used Matlab term refering to a cell array of strings.
